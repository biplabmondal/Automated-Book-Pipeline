      "Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon.  Behind him, the ocean roared, a furious symphony of crashing waves and wind-whipped spray.  But before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out – a vast, impossibly blue expanse, calm as a mirror, dotted with the graceful flight of fishing gulls.  This tranquil paradise, ringed by forty miles of protective coral, was *his*.  He’d only arrived yesterday, but already the place felt like a second skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beach bustled with activity: women, children, and young people, all working under the relentless tropical sun. They fished, played, tended their taro patches – his people, now.  The canoes pulled ashore, the empty houses that once held war canoes – all his.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as his eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe sheds, a frown creased his brow. He turned his back on the tranquil lagoon, facing the relentless power of the northern sea.  Beyond the horizon, invisible for now, lay Palm Tree Island – a vision of breathtaking beauty, yet a place teeming with the shadows of evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby, watching Dick intently. Tari was young, innocent, but he understood the vulnerability of his people. War had swept away the men of Karolin, leaving behind only women, children, and boys like himself – defenseless and leaderless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, bearing Dick and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago.  The women whispered of divine intervention – a new chief, sent by the gods.  Tari, oblivious to such mythology, and eager for answers, turned to Dick, his voice as pure as the lagoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Taori,\" he asked, \"who are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Could Dick have answered truthfully? Could Tari have understood the incredible journey, the strange saga he could tell?  He could have explained:  *“Tari, I come from a world beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange. As a child, I was shipwrecked on that island you call Palm Tree, fifty miles north. There, I lived with an old sailor, Kearney. He taught me to survive, to fish, to build little ships, nothing like your canoes. Then Katafa came, the girl lost in the storm. After Kearney died, she and I were alone. She taught me your language. She named me Taori. We loved each other. We might have stayed on Palm Tree forever, but then a ship arrived, filled with ruthless men from the eastern islands. They came to cut down the trees, then turned violent. They killed the other white men and burned the ship. We escaped in our little boat, guided by the lagoon’s light in the sky, and here we are.\" *\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dick couldn't. The name \"Dick\" felt distant, a forgotten echo.  The language of his childhood was gone. Kearney, his surrogate father, faded into the mists of memory. His past, clouded by years of isolation, began only with Katafa's arrival on Palm Tree. Everything before was swallowed by the incandescent light, the storms, the rain-soaked mists of that tropical island. Only Kearney's toy ships remained, a tangible link to a hazy past.\n",

      "\"I don't know,\" the boy replied, his attention already diverted by the shouts of children hauling in a fishing net. \"I ask like I breathe, but grown-ups never answer Tari's questions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick's gaze returned to the north.  Tari's question stirred dormant memories: the schooner, consumed by flames; his desperate escape with Katafa; their arrival on this beach; the villagers’ awe. He was their god-sent leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the memory of his escape also cast a dark shadow. The men who had taken Palm Tree posed a threat. They lacked canoes now, but they would build them. They would see the shimmering reflection of the Karolin lagoon, just as he had, and they would come. It might take time, but they would come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick was a kanaka, a savage in many ways, yet the white man remained within him. He could strategize, anticipate, and imagine.  That's why he'd sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – master canoe builders – and why his eyes had lit up at the sight of nearly a hundred youths reaching warrior age.  Underlying all his plans, fueling his daring, was his fierce love for Katafa, his other self, ever so subtly threatened.\n",

      "A hand rested on his shoulder.  He turned to find Katafa, a stray lock of raven hair escaping her vine headband, fluttering in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her dark eyes were fixed on the same point he'd been studying - the northern horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look,\" she whispered.\n",

      "Through a trick of the light – a mirage – Palm Tree, though far beyond the visible horizon, was emerging. Last night they'd seen it, and now it reappeared: a faint smudge, a darkening spot on the dazzling sea, slowly taking shape until, as if painted by an unseen hand, the island materialized – beautiful and ethereal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoulder to shoulder, they stood in silence.  Unschooled in meteorology, they knew only what their hearts understood. The island was rising from the sea, as if to confront them. They saw the savage horde on the beach, felt the wind in their sails as they fled, heard the cries of the Melanesians, drunk on stolen rum. The paradise before them hid its monstrous heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dick stared at the deceptive beauty, a primal hatred filled him. They had threatened him – that was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa – that was everything.  And they still threatened her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, they would come. Palm Tree seemed to repeat what instinct told him. They would build canoes, they would see the mirror-light of the lagoon, and they would come. They had no women – and Karolin had plenty.  Just as he was drawn to Katafa, they would be drawn to Karolin's women.  They would scan the horizon, seeking vulnerable prey.  And they would see the lagoon light…and come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew then, danger lurked not only to the north, but wherever hatred, greed, and lust prowled. Not just among savages, but among the \"civilized\" as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To Dick, the world was the ocean surrounding these two islands.  No Europe, no America, no history beyond his own short life, intertwined with Katafa's. Yet, even in this brief existence, he'd learned to fear men, and he understood the root of all history: man's endless capacity for war, plunder, and destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly, Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing like a snuffed candle. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe.  The canoe builders had arrived. Leaving their perch, they walked towards the beach to meet them.\n",

That's why he'd sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – master canoe builders – and why his eyes had lit up at the sight of nearly a hundred youths reaching warrior age.  Underlying all his plans, fueling his daring, was his fierce love for Katafa, his other self, ever so subtly threatened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "War canoes. To defend against invaders? Or to launch a preemptive strike? Only time would tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A hand rested on his shoulder.  He turned to find Katafa, a stray lock of raven hair escaping her vine headband, fluttering in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her dark eyes were fixed on the same point he'd been studying - the northern horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look,\" she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through a trick of the light – a mirage – Palm Tree, though far beyond the visible horizon, was emerging. Last night they'd seen it, and now it reappeared: a faint smudge, a darkening spot on the dazzling sea, slowly taking shape until, as if painted by an unseen hand, the island materialized – beautiful and ethereal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoulder to shoulder, they stood in silence.  Unschooled in meteorology, they knew only what their hearts understood. The island was rising from the sea, as if to confront them. They saw the savage horde on the beach, felt the wind in their sails as they fled, heard the cries of the Melanesians, drunk on stolen rum. The paradise before them hid its monstrous heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dick stared at the deceptive beauty, a primal hatred filled him. They had threatened him – that was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa – that was everything.  And they still threatened her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, they would come. Palm Tree seemed to repeat what instinct told him. They would build canoes, they would see the mirror-light of the lagoon, and they would come. They had no women – and Karolin had plenty.  Just as he was drawn to Katafa, they would be drawn to Karolin's women.  They would scan the horizon, seeking vulnerable prey.  And they would see the lagoon light…and come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew then, danger lurked not only to the north, but wherever hatred, greed, and lust prowled. Not just among savages, but among the \"civilized\" as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To Dick, the world was the ocean surrounding these two islands.  No Europe, no America, no history beyond his own short life, intertwined with Katafa's. Yet, even in this brief existence, he'd learned to fear men, and he understood the root of all history: man's endless capacity for war, plunder, and destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly, Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing like a snuffed candle. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe.  The canoe builders had arrived. Leaving their perch, they walked towards the beach to meet them.\n",
