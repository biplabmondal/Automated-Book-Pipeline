## The Gates of Morning: Book 1, Chapter 1 – The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral outcrop, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared—a furious symphony of crashing waves and wind-whipped spray. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin shimmered, a vast expanse of impossibly blue, calm as a mirror, broken only by the graceful flight of fishing gulls. This tranquil paradise, ringed by forty miles of protective coral, was his.  He’d arrived only yesterday, a stranger in a strange land, yet it already felt like home.

The beach bustled with activity: women, children, and young men—the entire tribe—toiled under the sun. They fished with nets, played games, and tended their taro patches. Their lives, their canoes beached on the sand, their empty houses that once echoed with the rhythmic thrum of war canoes… all were now his responsibility.

His eyes shifted from the tranquil lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown etching his brow. He turned his back on the peaceful water, facing the wild, untamed northern sea. Beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree Island, a breathtaking paradise—but a paradise infested with demons.

Little Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker’s son, watched him from the coral. Tari understood little of the world, but he knew this: war had swept away Karolin’s men, leaving the women and children defenseless and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying this stranger—Dick—and Katafa, the girl lost at sea years ago. The women whispered that he was a godsend, their new chief.

Tari, innocent and direct, blurted out the question burning in his young heart: "Taori," he asked, "who *are* you?"

Could Dick have answered truthfully? Could the child comprehend the incredible story? He *could* have said: “Tari, I come from a world far beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange. As a child, I was stranded on that island you call Palm Tree with an old sailor, Kearney. He taught me to survive, to build small toy ships—nothing like your canoes. Then Katafa arrived, the girl lost in the storm. We lived together until Kearney died. She taught me your language, and she named me Taori. We escaped from murderous men who sought to plunder the island, burning their ship in the process, and here we are.”

But he couldn't. The name "Dick," the language of his childhood, even the memory of Kearney—all were fading, swallowed by the intense light of his past. His memories began only with Katafa's arrival on Palm Tree; everything before was a hazy, dreamlike fog, the past consumed by the fierce tropical sun, relentless storms, and the damp mists of the rainy seasons. Only the toy ships, Kearney’s legacy, remained a tangible link to a forgotten life.

He looked down at the curious child. "I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied, his attention already diverted by children hauling in a net. "I ask because I breathe. But grown-ups… they never answer Tari's questions." And he scampered off.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. Tari's question stirred dormant memories: the schooner, the fire, the escape with Katafa in Kearney's old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, the women's awe. He, the man they believed sent by the gods…

But the memory of his escape, the faces of the men he’d left behind, stained the beauty of the sea and sky. There was no immediate threat; the men of Palm Tree had no canoes. But they *would* build canoes. They would see Karolin's shimmering lagoon reflected in the sky, just as he had. They *would* come. It might take time, but they would come.

Dick was a kanaka, a savage, yet the white man remained. He could strategize, plan, and imagine. That's why he’d sent a canoe to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—master canoe-builders—and why, when he’d looked upon his new tribe, he’d seen the potential: nearly a hundred young men, ready for war.  But beneath all this, fueling his ambition and driving him with relentless intensity, was his love for Katafa—a love subtly, yet undeniably, threatened.

War canoes. Would he defend the lagoon, or take the fight to the enemy, destroying the threat before it grew? No one knew.

A hand touched his shoulder. He turned to find Katafa, a stray lock of dark hair escaping her vine-bound braid, dancing in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the north, the same point he’d been gazing at.

"Look," she whispered.

Under specific weather conditions, Palm Tree Island, despite its distance, became visible through a mirage. Last night they'd seen it, and now it was reappearing, a faint smudge on the horizon, gradually sharpening, solidifying, until, as if painted by an invisible hand, the island materialized—as beautiful as a dream, yet chillingly familiar.

Shoulder to shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untainted by knowledge of mirages, their eyes locked on the scene of their escape. They saw again the savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare; they felt the wind in the dinghy’s sails, heard the Melanesians' drunken yells. And there, before them, was the paradise—a breathtaking facade concealing the horrors within.

As Dick gazed at this idyllic yet menacing vision, hatred flooded him. They’d threatened *him*—that was nothing. They’d threatened Katafa—that was everything. And they still threatened her.

Someday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo the instinct gnawing at his gut: They would build canoes, they would see the lagoon's reflection in the sky, and they would come. They craved women, and Karolin had women. Just as he was drawn to Katafa, these men would be drawn to Karolin's women. They would search the horizon, raid for wives, and, guided by the lagoon's light, they would come.

He realized then that danger wasn't just to the north, but everywhere greed and hatred lurked on the azure sea; not just among savages, but among the "civilized" wolves as well.

For Dick, there was no world beyond the ocean that encircled the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history except his own short life and Katafa's. Yet even in that short life, he had learned to fear men, to understand the dark foundation of history—mankind's inherent instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

The vision of Palm Tree faded, vanishing like a snuffed-out candle. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe. It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe-builders. Leaving the coral, they walked towards the beach to meet it.
